## Objective 
The main objective of this project is to  analyze campaign performance for the last 5 months and optimize the performance of paid search campaign to maximize conversions and revenue while minimizing costs. The focus lies on achieving three important objectives: 
  1 **Maximize Conversions** : The goal is to increase campaign’s ability to convert potential prospects into actual customers. By analyzing conversion rates and paths from impressions, clicks to conversions, we’ll identify campaigns from ad groups that are successful from a conversion standpoint so that they can be recommended to marketing managers for optimization.
  2 **Increase Profits** : Another important goal is to increase the impact of campaigns on the profitability of shopping malls. By examining metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) and Profit Loss, we can uncover insights about which ad groups and keywords are generating the most revenue. This information enables data-driven decisions to allocate resources effectively and invest in the areas that generate the highest returns.
  3 **Minimize Cost** : The third goal focuses on optimizing costs. By evaluating metrics such as Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Conversion, we aim to identify areas where costs can be reduced without sacrificing campaign performance. This approach ensures that marketing budgets are allocated efficiently, resulting in higher ROI and increased profitability.
